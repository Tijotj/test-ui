# Project is about user statics and details of courses in a college

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Challenges
Sorting is incomplete.

The requirement is for using fetch api but I tried api calling using get method. A file called marks.json was used for API calling and it is placed in the root folder.
